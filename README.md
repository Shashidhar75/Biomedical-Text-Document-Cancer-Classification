# Biomedical-Text-Document-Cancer-Classification
I developed this project to classify biomedical text into different cancer types, helping researchers and medical professionals quickly extract meaningful insights from large volumes of medical literature

Biomedical Text Document Cancer Classification
📌 Overview

This project focuses on classifying biomedical research texts into cancer categories (Thyroid, Colon, and Lung). It aims to support researchers and clinicians in retrieving relevant information faster from large medical literature collections.

⚙️ Methods & Tools

Preprocessing: Text cleaning, lemmatization, synonym-based dataset balancing, TF-IDF.

Models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression (Bayesian optimization), and BioBERT.

Deployment: Flask-based web app for real-time cancer text classification.

📊 Results

BioBERT achieved the highest accuracy of 97%, outperforming traditional models.

Logistic Regression (95%) and Naive Bayes (91%) served as strong baselines.

📂 Dataset
